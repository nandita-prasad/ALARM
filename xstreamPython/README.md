# xStream - Python

[https://cmuxstream.github.io](https://cmuxstream.github.io)

This implementation is in Python 2.7 and works on static data.

## Prerequisites

Python packages can be installed via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example

The `test_xstream.py` script contains an example of using xStream on a synthetic
static dataset `synDataNoisy.tsv`. The original dataset contained 3082 rows in
3 dimensions, with two non-anomalous clusters (depicted below in blue and orange)
and various anomalies.

The noisy dataset contains 100 additional columns containing Gaussian noise,
with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.05.

To test xStream and iForest on this noisy dataset:

```
python test_xstream.py
```
